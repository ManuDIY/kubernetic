# Limit Ranges

## Limit Ranges

Limit Ranges helps define boundaries on the memory and cpu that Pods can claim on each namespace. This helps cluster operators manage the resources efficiently.

For more information about Limit Ranges checkout the [Kubernetes User Guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/limitrange/).

In this tutorial we'll configure Limit Ranges to the `kubernetic-tutorial` namespace.

### Limit Range Sample

Go to the tutorial chart repo and run the `limitrange-sample` chart.

Here is the Limit Range definition:

```text
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: mylimits
spec:
  limits:
  - max:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: 1Gi
    min:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 6Mi
    type: Pod
  - default:
      cpu: 300m
      memory: 200Mi
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 100Mi
    max:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: 1Gi
    min:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 3Mi
    type: Container
```

Now go to the Limit Ranges section. You'll see the `mylimits` Limit Range that configures the limits of cpu and memory.

If you select the Limit Range `mylimits` you'll see details about the limits of memory and cpu.

## Cleanup

You can now delete the release of the `limitrange-sample` chart.
