# Charts

In Charts section we manage the Helm Charts.

### Requirements

In order for Charts to be functional in Kubernetic, Helm's cluster component **Tiller** needs to be deployed on the cluster. Check [here](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) for more details how to prepare the cluster.

Once helm's tiller is installed the following command should respond with client and server version

```bash
> helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.9.0", GitCommit:"f6025bb9ee7daf9fee0026541c90a6f557a3e0bc", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.9.0", GitCommit:"f6025bb9ee7daf9fee0026541c90a6f557a3e0bc", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```
