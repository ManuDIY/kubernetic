## Config Maps

The ConfigMap API resource holds key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to store configuration data for system components such as controllers.

For more information about Config Maps checkout the [Kubernetes User Guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/).

In this Tutorial you'll learn how to create a Config Map

### Config Map Sample

Go to the tutorial chart repo and run the `configmap-sample` chart.

Here is the Config Map definition:

```text
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: configmap-sample
data:
  key-a: bob
  key-b: alice
  key-c: |
    This is a multiline
    data value
```

Now go to the Config Maps section. You'll see the `configmap-sample` Config Map.

## Cleanup

Go to the Releases section

Delete the release of the `configmap-sample-0.1.0` chart.

This will trigger the deletion of all items generated by the Chart.
